We are building a Sanity Studio and a Sanity SDK App for a learning management system.

The Studio is in the /studio directory. It follows the standard conventions for a Sanity v3 Studio.

The Sanity SDK app is in /sales-academy. It uses the Sanity App SDK library, specifically @sanity/sdk

Do not make any changes in /frontend. It is not used at the moment
