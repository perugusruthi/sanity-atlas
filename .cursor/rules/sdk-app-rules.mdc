This is a React app built with the Sanity App SDK tooling. It uses the @sanity/react-sdk library to interact with the Sanity dataset that contains all the content and data.

Do not use @sanity/client directly. Only use the functions and hooks provided by @sanity/react-sdk to fetch and update data.

This is not a Sanity Studio. Sanity Studio and Sanity App SDK are different things.
